# PowerBI-Reports
This repository contains PowerBI reports that I have created using different datasets available on the internet.

1. Video Game Report - This report was created using dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales and displays some key metrics from the sales report such as All time Best Publisher and All Time Best Developer. Additionally, it has a drill-through feature which allows analysis of specific time period and/or genre.
  
2. Eyetracking - This report was created using a single experiment eye-tracking recording obtained by me during a trial with a patient. The participant was instructed to perform a TUG (Time Up and Go) test which comprises of:
3. - Participant sat on a chair
   - Participant gets up
   - Participant walks around a traffic cone placed around 2-3m away from the chair
   - Participant sits back down on the same chair
  
   TUG tests are often used in post-stroke patients to assess balance, cognitive functions and obstacle negotiation. During the trials we obtained interesting data such as number of fixations and saccades as well as how often the participant looked at the obstacle (traffic cone). The report illustrates some of these key metrics.
